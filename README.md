This Employee Management Web Application fully implements all the requested features and requirements:

● Employee Records Listing

        Employees are displayed in a table view with pagination and search functionality.

        Users can edit or delete any employee directly from the list.

        The listing is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile.

● Add New Employee

        A reusable form allows adding a new employee with all required fields: First Name, Last Name, Employment/Birth Dates, Phone, Email, Department, and Position.

        Validation ensures correct input formats and prevents duplicate phone numbers or emails.

        After submission, users are redirected back to the employee list.

● Edit Existing Employee

        The same form is used for editing, prefilled with the employee’s data.

        A confirmation modal prompts before saving updates.

        Validations are applied consistently to maintain data integrity.

● Delete Employee

        Deleting an employee prompts a confirmation modal to prevent accidental deletions.

        The list updates immediately after deletion.

● Navigation & Routing

        A dedicated navigation menu allows switching between pages.

        Vaadin Router handles routing for /employees, /employees/new, and /employees/:id.

● State Management & Persistence

        Employee data is stored in browser memory using a custom storage utility.

        Changes persist during the session without a backend.

● Localization Support

        Components are fully multilingual (English and Turkish).

        The application dynamically reads the lang attribute from the root HTML.

● Responsive Design

        All pages and components adapt seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

        No CSS frameworks like Bootstrap were used.

● Unit Testing

        Detailed unit tests cover all components and functions.

Coverage exceeds 85%, ensuring reliability.
